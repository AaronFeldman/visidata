## What is VisiData?

VisiData is an open source multitool for data exploration and manipulation.

When it comes to data wrangling:

    - Python is a powerful and ubiquitous platform for data processing, transformation, and integration;
    - the spreadsheet is an intuitive and flexible paradigm for exploratory analysis;
    - the terminal is an efficient and universal interface;

VisiData unites Python, spreadsheet, and terminal into a lightweight tool that handles gigabyte datasets with ease.
