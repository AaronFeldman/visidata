## How can I graph a column?

Set the column to a numeric type (int or float or currency, maybe even date).
Press `.` (dot=plot) on the column.

Make it a [key column]() with `!`.

Set all the columns to a numeric type.
Hide any numeric columns you don't want graphed.
Press `g.` (gee-dot=big-plot).
