# Support VisiData Development

VisiData is an open-source tool that can be installed and used freely (as in speech), under the terms of GPL3.

The base VisiData utility and library are also free (as in beer).
Customized loaders and packages can be created for a small fee.
Contact Saul (see below) for more information.
