Title: VisiData v0.98, now with graphs and maps (experimental)

When I announced that v0.97 was "feature complete", I must have been talking about vdtui.
vdtui has been pretty stable, even as VisiData has added a low-resolution pixel canvas
(using Braille unicode characters) to draw graphs and maps.  In fact, apart from a few bug
fixes and small API changes, the only addition to vdtui in v0.98 is basic mouse support.

Here's a list of what's new in v0.98:

- [canvas] graphs and maps!
   - `.` or `g.` to push a graph or a map from the current sheet (dot=plot)
   - supports .shp and vector .mbtiles
   - mouse left-click/drag to set cursor
   - mouse right-click/drag to scroll canvas
   - scrollwheel to zoom in/out on a canvas
   - 's'/'u' to select/unselect rows at canvas cursor
   - ENTER to push source sheet with only rows at canvas cursor
   - 1-9 to toggle display of 'layers' (colors)
   - '_' to zoom out to full width
   - options.disp_pixel_random 
   - '+'/'-' to zoom in/out via keyboard

- Updates to commands
   - Remove `\`` backtick command
   - Remove most zscroll commands (zs/ze)
     - `zz` moves cursor to center
   - `z_` sets column width to given value
   - `z-` cuts column width in half
   - `P` is now "paste before" (like vim); `R` now pushes a random sample
   - `^Z` now sends SIGSTOP; `^O` "opens" the external $EDITOR (from builtin line editor)
   - [ColumnsSheet] Added `~!@#$` commands back to ColumnsSheet, to set type of source columns
   - `w` is becoming a more universal "visibility toggle"
      - [TextSheet] `w` toggles wordwrap
      - [canvas] `w` toggles display of the labels
      - [pyobj] `w` toggles hidden properties and methods

- Updates to command line args and options
   - set initial row/col with +row:col (numeric only)
   - `delimiter` option (separate from csv_delimiter) sets delimiter for tsv filetype
   - `-d` on command line sets tsv delimiter (like other unix utilities)
   - Use `-w` (`--replay-wait`) instead of previous `-d` (`--delay`) option
   - `disp_date_fmt` option for date fmtstr (default is date-only)
   - options.*_is_null to set which values are considered null (previously was aggr_null_filter)

- Design improvements
   - Add specific rowtype for each sheet (see right status)
   - dates are a kind of numeric type (useful for graphing as the x-axis)
   - `use_default_colors` (at behest of @wavexx)
   - more robust Progress indicator
   - DescribeSheet populates in async thread

- visidata.org revamp
