# VisiData documentation

* VisiData's [manpage](/man) contains a comprehensive overview of all global and sheet-specific commands.

* The [system tests](/test) provide examples of how VisiData's atomic commands can be combined for complex workflows.

* [CONTRIBUTING.md](/contributing) contains information on how to contribute to VisiData's ongoing development.

* There are a few VisiData [demo videos](/videos). More are in the works, but please let us know if there are any features in particular you wish to learn more about.

## For developers

The dream is for VisiData to be able to interact with data from any source or in any format.

Creating a loader for a new data source is easy and usually takes only an hour or two.  It's fun and rewarding to create a great terminal interface for your favorite data source.

Currently, VisiData supports [tsv, csv, json, html, sqlite, hdf5, xlsx, xls, shp, and mbtiles file formats.  We would love to find devs interested in creating interfaces for all other data sources.
