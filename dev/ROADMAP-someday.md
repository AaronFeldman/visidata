VisiData tasks that are looking for a lovely home!

These are tasks that are not on the immediate developer roadmap, and are looking for someone to take the lead on them. If any of them draw you in, and you would like to help drive their implementation, [open an issue](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/new) or reopen the linked issue.

- sniff filetype from the data itself: [issue](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/130)
