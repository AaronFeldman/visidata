#### I. Interface

- mouse-ability
    - allow user to disable mouse for system copy/paste
    - clickable column headers to set type/name, click-drag to move columns/rows
    - clickable status items (including motd)
    - info mode: mouse hover describes interface components and/or shows relevant commands
- undo
    - start from previous sheet in commandlog
    - replay all but last command

- skip to next error
- weakref for all Sheets, viewable with gS (partial guard against losing intermediate steps)
   - start/drop datetimes
   - number of derivative sheets (two columns, for immediate children and to any depth)
   - number of commands executed on that sheet (as a list so they can be viewed separately)

#### II. Internals

- break out into library, usable standalone by other apps
   - Progress/async
   - Canvas
- SourceSheet inherits from Sheet

#### III. Loaders and Savers

- parquet
- .xml

- google sheets
- save to .py: emit code to get current cell/row/sheet from source data
- sqlite: allow in-memory edits, ^S to commit
- save canvas to .svg (canvassave_svg)
- multisave_hdf5

#### IV. other commands and features

- numeric binning for freq column and pivot table
- quintile/decile/percentile aggregators
- rowmax aggregator ( rowmax(field) gets whole row)
- add row number in hidden column on data sheets so that original (load) order can be restored
- handle timezone for datetime
