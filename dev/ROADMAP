# Roadmap

## Future

### plugin api/package manager

- use snippets without git clone
- in-app downloadable/installable snippets

### stable apis

- refactor Canvas into reusable component

### productization

- windows installer/version

### content

- design blog posts
- putting together a talk on visidata design/internals
- make separate webpages for: devops, sysadmins, hackers, git users, bioinfers, etc

### misc

- 'v' hide cols which have errors on cursor row
- modified indicator on status bar, also enables quitguard
- ColumnsSheet should show subcolumns and their parent column (for expand/contract)
- fill on join nulls should cause error
- tab completion of macros in exec-longname, requires command overhaul
- csv with NUL bytes should parse.  safe_mode? (slow but handles these kinds of things)


### features

#### I. Interface

- mouse-ability
    - allow user to disable mouse for system copy/paste
    - clickable column headers to set type/name, click-drag to move columns/rows
    - clickable status items (including motd)
    - info mode: mouse hover describes interface components and/or shows relevant commands
- undo
    - start from previous sheet in commandlog
    - replay all but last command

- skip to next error
+ graveyard sheet
   - start/drop datetimes
   - number of derivative sheets (two columns, for immediate children and to any depth)
   - number of commands executed on that sheet (as a list so they can be viewed separately)

#### II. Internals

- break out into library, usable standalone by other apps
   - Progress/async
   - Canvas
- SourceSheet inherits from Sheet

#### III. Loaders and Savers

- parquet
- .mdb, .accdb
- google sheets
- save to .py: emit code to get current cell/row/sheet from source data
- sqlite: allow in-memory edits, ^S to commit
  - index sheet: include rows/cols; allow to be cutnpasted
  - solve "load in other thread" problem
- save canvas to .svg (canvassave_svg)
- multisave_hdf5

#### IV. other commands and features

- numeric binning for freq column and pivot table
- rowmax aggregator ( rowmax(field) gets whole row)
- add row number in hidden column on data sheets so that original (load) order can be restored
- handle timezone for datetime
- options should allow list or dict of enum values
- column helpstr (esp for non-data sheets)
- macro parameterization
- g^D bug report
- zip/unzip from dirsheet
- status rework: use logging module; color status items; use multiple lines on overflow
- proper dive on json

##### technical debt

- either remove all asserts; possibly replace with error()

#### V. website

- /features grid
- front page redesign
- /blog of topic/design discussions

# VI. other applications with a vd-like interface

- [vgit](http://github.com/saulpw/vgit) (currently v0.2)
- [vsh](http://github.com/saulpw/vsh) (unreleased)
   - vtop (includes kill/killall/ps)
   - vls (rm/mv/cp/mount/find/grep/mkdir/rmdir/ln/touch)
   - vnet (netstat)
   - vping
   - vproc (explore /proc filesystem with some added goodies)
- vsql
- vpy (python explorer/debugger)
- vchat
- [vdgalcon](http://github.com/saulpw/vdgalcon)
- vscrape
- vdbg
- vaws
