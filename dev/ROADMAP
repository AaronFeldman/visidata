# Roadmap to 2.0

## 1. Stable, Documented Internal Python API

- to reuse internal VisiData components in non-VisiData TUIs
- to create external plugins/apps for use within VisiData (see below)
- api.tsv
- proper sandbox for exec (for some plugin safety)

## 2. Plugin api/package manager

+ deprecate vdtui.py as single file dropin TUI
   + same functionality will be available as visidata.vdtui
- in-app downloadable/installable snippets

## 3. Split panes

- horizontal or vertical split
- no more than two panes
- one pane can be dependent on the other; e.g. move cursor in one, see preview update in other

## 4. Undo #141

+ infinite linear undo/redo

## 5. Simple non-python installers

- .dmg for macos
- .exe for windows
- both include full Python install

## 6. save code to get to current sheet/row/cell

- remove superfluous sheets
- output .sql or .py code
- or as jupyter-style notebook

## 7. Mouse-ability

- allow user to disable mouse for system copy/paste
- clickable column headers to set type/name, click-drag to move columns/rows
- clickable status items (including motd)
- info mode: mouse hover describes interface components and/or shows relevant commands

## 8. Integrate DeferredSet to all sheets

- 'modified' indicator on status bar, also enables quitguard
+ sqlite: allow in-memory edits, ^S to commit
  - index sheet: include rows/cols; allow to be cutnpasted
  + solve "load in other thread" problem

## 9. Loaders and Savers

+ parquet #112
- .mdb, .accdb
- google sheets
- save canvas to .svg (canvassave_svg)
- multisave_hdf5

## 10. Other additions

- 'v' hide cols which have errors on cursor row
   - or should 'v' be 'toggle-visibility' on all sheets?
- [ColumnsSheet] show subcolumns and their parent column (for expand/contract)
- [cmdlog] add timestamp?

- graveyard sheet improvements
   - start/drop datetimes
   - number of derivative sheets (two columns, for immediate children and to any depth)
   - number of commands executed on that sheet (as a list so they can be viewed separately)

- error history with error objects
- error sheet showing row-form traceback
   - ^O to edit

- numeric binning for freq column and pivot table
- rowmax aggregator ( rowmax(field) gets whole row)
- add row number in hidden column on data sheets so that original (load) order can be restored
- handle timezone for datetime
- options should allow list or dict of enum values
- column helpstr (esp for non-data sheets)
- macro parameterization
- g^D bug report
- zip/unzip from dirsheet
- status rework: use logging module?  use multiple lines on overflow?
- proper dive on json
- tech debt: remove all asserts; possibly replace with error()

- add "/flags" to regex commands for per-instance regex flags
- SI() units converter
- new command: apply action/macro to each selected row
- add "transforms list" to column (type is last transform)


# Other applications with a vd-like interface

- [vgit](http://github.com/saulpw/vgit) (currently v0.2)
    like magit but for vim/visidata/python users
- [vsh](http://github.com/saulpw/vsh) (unreleased)
   - vtop (includes kill/killall/ps)
   - vls (rm/mv/cp/mount/find/grep/mkdir/rmdir/ln/touch)
   - vnet (netstat)
   - vping
   - vproc (explore /proc filesystem with some added goodies)
- vsql: interacts with remote sql databases; no loading required
   - save commandlog as .sql
- vpy (python explorer/debugger)
   - save commandlog as python code
- vchat
- [vdgalcon](http://github.com/saulpw/vdgalcon)
- vscrape
   - convenient interface to REST and other APIs
   - point at a website and collect datasets, tables, textual data
   - add jq-style selectors
- vstats
   - save commandlog as ipynb, markdown, or html
- vdbg
- vaws
- `vd --server` pops up a local web server, for a visidata-like web interface to local files
