# Roadmap to 2.0

## API

The primary goal of 2.0 is a stable, documented Python API that can be used to create an broad ecosystem of loaders, plugins, and apps.

Deliverables:

- api.tsv
- proper sandbox for exec (for some plugin safety)

## Split panes

- horizontal or vertical split
- one pane can be dependent on the other; e.g. move cursor in one, see preview update in other
- use for choosing aggregators, command help, other choose()

## Installers

- .pkg for macos
- .exe for windows
- snap for linux

## Minor features

- 'modified' indicator on status bar, also enables quitguard

## Refactor and Cleanup

- numeric binning for pivot table
- remove all asserts; replace with error() on case-by-case basis

## Loaders and Savers

- [google sheets] loader with savesToSource
- [sqlite] index sheet, include rows/cols; allow to be cutnpasted
- [canvas] Canvas.save_svg
- [hdf5] multisave_hdf5
- [ipybnb] Sheet.save_ipynb
- [sql] Sheet.save_sql

# Features

- Memory sheet; can give things names and use in expressions.
   - 'show' commands are copied there by default.

# Polish Wishlist

- [options] allow list or dict of enum values
- [datetime] handle timezone
- [currency] track currency kind/symbol
- SI display format (1210000000 -> 1.21G)
- [columns] add helpstr for all specialized-sheet columns
- [columns] add "transforms list" to column (type is last transform)
- [status] use multiple lines on overflow
- [dirsheet] archive/extract (zip/unzip and relatives)
- [regex] add "/flags" to regex commands for per-instance regex flags
- [select starting sheet in html/xls/sqlite from command-line](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/214)
