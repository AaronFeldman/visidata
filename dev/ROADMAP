# Roadmap to 2.0

## API

The primary goal of 2.0 is a stable, documented Python API that can be used to create an broad ecosystem of loaders, plugins, and apps.

The Book of VisiData will describe the api and all functions and objects available to plugins and command execstrs.

## Split panes

- horizontal or vertical split
- one pane can be dependent on the other; e.g. move cursor in one, see preview update in other
- use for choosing aggregators, command help, other choose()

- DirSheet file preview #309

## Minor features, refactors, cleanup

- 'modified' indicator on status bar, also enables quitguard
- remove all asserts; replace with error() on case-by-case basis

- [options] allow list or dict of enum values for default

# Features

- Memory sheet; can give things names and use in expressions.
   - 'show' commands are copied there by default.

- [columns] add helpstr for all specialized-sheet columns
