Welcome to vdtutor	an interactive tutorial
	
If you get stuck somewhere unfamiliar,	try these keys:
	
To drop the current sheet	q
To abort a command expecting input	Ctrl-c
To exit the program immediately	Ctrl-q
To see the last error	Ctrl-e
	
#	Sheet1
	
So let's get started with	some basic concepts:
	
All screens in VisiData are	sheets
Sheets have	rows and columns
Inside VisiData, there are	no cells
Any apparent cell is	just one row as viewed by one column
This is the zen of VisiData.
	
The row cursor is highlighted in	reverse
The column cursor is highlighted in	bold
[These display elements can be changed in	the 'O'ptions sheet]
	
To move the cursor	press these keys:
	
Left Down Up Right	h j k l
PageUp PageDown	Ctrl-b Ctrl-f
	
Many commands can be modified with	the 'g' prefix
With movement commands, 'g' makes the cursor	go all the way in that direction
	
leftmost bottom top rightmost	gh gj gk gl
	
Go ahead and try it; can you bring the cursor to	this cell and press ENTER?
