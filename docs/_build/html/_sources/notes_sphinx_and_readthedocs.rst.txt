Sphinx and Read the Docs Set-up
===============================

Sphinx set-up
-------------

#. Sphinx is installed via ``pip``. Do initial set-up with ``sphinx-quickstart``. Here we have followed all defaults except::

      > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: n

#. In the auto-populated ``index.rst`` there are three additions to make.

   a. At very the top of the file, add::

         :tocdepth: 2


   b. Change ``:maxdepth: 2`` to ``:maxdepth: 4``.

   c. Below ``:caption: Contents:`` add the name of each file containing documentation::

         home
         user-guide
         dev-guide
         screen-layout
         dev-cursors
         about/contributing
         about/credits

#. In the auto-populated ``conf.py`` you can set the Sphinx them and its options. Themes are listed `on the Sphinx site <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/theming.html>`_. Declare a theme by setting ``html_theme`` to a string containing the name of the theme; declare its options by setting ``html_theme_options`` to a dictionary containing key-value pairs for each option, following the page linked to above.

   ``sphinx-quickstart`` defaults to ``alabaster``. We have used ``bizstyle`` with option ``'rightsidebar': True``. 

   By default Read the Docs uses a custom theme "`Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_". You can reate other custom themes using ``INI`` format, as described `on the Sphinx site <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/theming.html>`_.

#. ``sphinx-quickstart`` creates a ``Makefile`` which will construct HTML straigtforwardly::

      make html

#. If ``make`` runs without errors, ``index.html`` will contain your table of contents and documentation. You can now stage, commit, and push the current contents of the repository. 

Read the Docs Set-up
--------------------

#. In order to use Read the Docs, you need to sign up for an account. The service is free to use, but support may cost money.

#. To import a new project, use the `manual import page of the Dashboard <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/import/manual/>`_ and click the "Import a Project" button. 

   If you grant Read the Docs admin access to your Git-hosting repository (at https://readthedocs.org/accounts/social/connections/), it will attempt to build a new set of docs each time a commit is pushed, via webhooks. You can also build new docs manually, in the absence of a valid webhook.
