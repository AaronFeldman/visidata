We love to build loaders with people that are familiar with the format and how it is used.  Knowing about quirks and variations and usage-in-the-wild is very hepful.

To that end, a new loader can be created quite quickly with the following:

1) A small sample representative dataset in that format.

2) A basic Python script which queries and dumps the data (possibly using an external package).
