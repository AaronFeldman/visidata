Handle my own basic workflow first.  Add more advanced functionality as individual use cases as needed.

Use cases:
  - checkout existing github
  - setup repo options/remotes
  - resolve merge
  - --since= --until= (filter by date)
  - select/trace ancestors, trace lines in file
Sheets:

- file sheet: main file listing, staged green, unstaged diffs yellow, conflicts red.
    - 'a':  `git add {cursorRow.filename}`
    - 'ga': `git add -a`
    - 'A' is `git add -p {cursorRow.filename}`, and pushes chunk sheet of diffs with all selected by default;
          - 'a' adds current patch/chunk to index
          - 'ga' adds all selected chunks to index.
    - ENTER shows the conflict, probably with a means of resolving it (vimdiff?)
    - '??'/'??' takes our/their version.  'g'?? for all conflicted files
- config sheet: config globals
- branch sheet: branch view (ENTER dives into a branch), command to create new branches
   - tags
   - remotes

- history/log sheet: one row per commit
- diff sheet: one row per chunk
- grep/matches sheet:
- blame sheet
- stash sheet
- 

- command: push to upstream
- command: pull from upstream
- command: discard change(s)
- command: git grep
  - pushes matches sheet, ENTER loads file in
    editor
