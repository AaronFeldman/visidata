## smoke tests
- launch with no arguments, see files in the current directory
- choose a text file (without type, or unknown type), and ENTER to view it
- scroll all the way down and back up with j/k/pgdn/pgup/gk/gj
- if an error is hit, use 'E' to examine the last error, or '^E' to exit as a last resort

## general movement
- with wide csv, scroll to rightmost column with 'l' and 'gl'.  cell contents should be entirely visible.
- cursor should never be offscreen, and rightmost column should not be truncated if cursor is on it

### specifics
- check text viewer with unicode
- how to view line longer than width of terminal?

## formats

- .tsv (with and without header row)
- .csv (changing delimiters and other options)
- .txt with TSV data
- .hdf5
- .xlsx
- .json (with deep and varied data arrangements)

### specifics

- change the extension on a file and watch it load as .txt.  'R' to reset the type.  and/or change parsing 'O'ptions.  either way, '^R' reload.

## Pin columns

### design details
- key column header attr like header attr -- yellow+bold.  not same as column attr (brown).

## 'S'heets sheet

### goals
- never any duplicate sheet entries on the sheets sheet

### specifics
- ENTER on sheets sheet while cursor is on the sheets sheet should be no-op
- after choosing an existing sheet, sheets sheet should not remain on next entry.
- move around and see sheets.cursorValue change.  go to sheets.cursorValue, see Â¿.  press 'E' and see reason.

## 'C'olumns sheet

### specifics
- change column size, go back to that sheet (should be parsed as int)

- open 'O'ptions sheet
  - edit an interface option (e.g. set , see that it's reflected in the interface
