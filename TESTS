## general movement
- with wide csv, scroll to rightmost column with 'l' and 'gl'.  cell contents should be entirely visible.
- cursor should never be offscreen, and rightmost column should not be truncated if cursor is on it

## formats

- .csv (with and without header row, changing delimiters and other options, reloading)
- .tsv (with and without header row)
- .txt with TSV (with and without header row)
- .hdf5
- .xlsx
- .zip
- directory

## Pin columns

### design details
- key column header attr like header attr -- yellow+bold.  not same as column attr (brown).

## 'S'heets sheet

### goals
- never any duplicate sheet entries on the sheets sheet

### specifics
- ENTER on sheets sheet while cursor is on the sheets sheet should be no-op
- after choosing an existing sheet, sheets sheet should not remain on next entry.

## 'C'olumns sheet

### specifics
- change column size, go back to that sheet (should be parsed as int)
