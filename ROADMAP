# Feature Roadmap

A loose plan that is subject to change.

## v0.5 data trail
- save sources to .zip cache
- edit/transform log
    - can be replayed to generate exact duplicate sheet
    - undo just removes the last edit item and replays to that point
- checkpoint data for faster replay

## v0.55 better interface for regex transforms:
- subst regex match in cells
- delete regex match in cells
- create versioned columns on subst/delete

## v0.6
- sql dbs via sqlalchemy
- save all sheets to .h5 file
- save sheets layout, including generated sheets and visible columns (via replay mechanism?)
- fixed-column detector

## v0.7 alpha
- popup windows for enum selection

## v0.8
- '.' repeat command

## v0.9
- simple file management in VSheetDir:
  - rename with 'e'dit
  - mass rename with transform
  - ^Delete
  - only apply changes with ^S

## v1.0
- Python expressions should be usable like regex for search, select, etc
- generic mechanism for coloring rows
    - highlight key rows on Columns sheet same as key column
- bulk interface (command line, macros?)

## v1.1
- connect to larger datasets (via blaze?)
- document Python3 API for import by other scripts
- load new .py plugins for inputs/outputs/sheets
   - git app that can streamline standard workflows
     - checkout branch or revision with TUI interface
     - browse through history


## Unscheduled
- reload derived sheets
- sort by keycols with g[ and g]
- html table parsing into columns
- parse .xml
- save as .json
- better csv/tsv sniffer
- dive back into source
- freeze sheet values
- how to handle timezone for datetime
- backtick to run shell command and parse output

### Details

- maintain original ordering with implicit/hidden line# column
