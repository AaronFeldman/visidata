# vgit roadmap

A loose plan that is subject to change

- conflict resolution
- checkout one file from a different branch
- edit arbitrary commit message with automatic rebase
- streamlined rebase workflow

- GitStatus
   - directory summary (ENTER to dive)
   - ^Z on file to edit in $EDITOR
   - ENTER to dive into a submodule pushes a new GitStatus

- Branches
  - reset 'H'EAD to this commit
  - 'R'ebase selected commits on top of HEAD
  - create tag

- Diffs
  - j/k or up/down to jump hunks.  or </> ?
  - 1/2/3 to set index to that column
  - should not remove content from working tree

- Blame
  - ENTER goes to that commit
  - '' goes to list of all commits for that file
